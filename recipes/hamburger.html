    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Beef:</strong> These basic burgers start with 1 ½ pounds of lean
        ground beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion: </strong>A finely chopped onion takes the flavor up a
        notch.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheese:</strong> You’ll need shredded Colby Jack or Cheddar
        cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Egg: </strong>An egg lends moisture and helps bind the patties
        together.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seasonings, herbs,</strong> and <strong>sauces:</strong> These
        hamburgers are flavored with an envelope of dry onion soup mix, fresh
        garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, dried parsley,
        dried basil, dried oregano, crushed dried rosemary, salt, and pepper.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Gather all ingredients. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and
        lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, combine ground beef, onion, cheese, egg, onion soup mix,
        minced garlic, garlic powder, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, parsley,
        basil, oregano, rosemary, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.
      </li>
      <li>Use your hands to form the mixture into 4 patties.</li>
      <li>
        Cook patties on the preheated grill until no longer pink in the center
        and the juices run clear, about 4 to 5 minutes per side.
      </li>
      <li>
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at
        least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
    </ol>
